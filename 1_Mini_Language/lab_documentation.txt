Objective:
-----------
The objective of this lab was to understand the process of defining a formal language specification, 
and to develop a small program using the C++ language following the syntax and semantics rules provided.

Language Specification:
------------------------
1. Alphabet:
   - The language includes uppercase and lowercase English letters (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9), and the underscore '_'.
   - Reserved words include standard keywords from the C++ language (e.g., int, char, while, if, else, return).

2. Lexical Elements:
   - Special symbols include operators like +, -, *, /, and comparison operators like ==, <=, >=.
   - Identifiers are sequences of letters and digits that start with a letter or an underscore.
   - Constants include integers, characters, and strings.

3. Syntax Rules:
   - Programs begin with an include directive and the main function (int main()).
   - Variable declarations specify types such as int, float, char, and arrays.
   - Statements include assignment, control flow (if, while, for), and I/O operations.
   - Conditions use relational operators (e.g., ==, !=, <, >) to compare expressions.


Example Code:
-------------
This C++ program is a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division. It prompts the user to input two integers and an operator (+, -, *, or /). 
The program then evaluates the operation and displays the result. 

Conclusion:
-----------
This lab helped solidify the understanding of language specification by writing rules for lexical elements and syntax. 
We also applied these concepts to develop a simple calculator program in C++. The program demonstrated the use of variables, conditionals, loops, and input/output operations in C++.
