Language Specification for Restricted C++:

1. Language Definition:

1.1 Alphabet:
1.1.a Uppercase (A-Z) and lowercase letters (a-z) of the English alphabet.
1.1.b Underscore character '_'.
1.1.c Decimal digits (0-9).

Lexical Elements:

a. Special Symbols representing:
- Operators: + - * / = < <= >= == != && || ++ --
- Separators: ( ) { } [ ] , ; space

b. Reserved Words (Keywords):
int, char

c. Identifiers:
An identifier is a sequence of letters, digits, and underscores such that the first character must be a letter or an underscore. The rule is:
identifier ::= letter | "_" {letter | digit | "_" | "."}
letter ::= "A" | "B" | . . . | "Z" | "a" | "b" | . . . | "z"
digit ::= "0" | "1" | . . . | "9"
- Maximum length: 20 characters

d. Constants:
1. Integer - Rule:
int_const ::= digit{digit}
- Must be non-negative and up to 5 digits long.

2. Character - Rule:
char_const ::= ''' printable_char '''
printable_char ::= letter | digit | symbol

3. String - Rule:
string_const ::= '"' char_seq '"'
char_seq ::= printable_char{char_seq}

2. Syntax:

Predefined tokens are represented between quotation marks "".

a) Syntactical Rules:
program ::= include_directive "int" "main" "(" ")" block

include_directive ::= "#include" "<iostream>"

block ::= "{" stmt_list "}"
stmt_list ::= stmt | stmt stmt_list

b) Declarations:
Variable Declaration:
declaration ::= type IDENTIFIER [ "=" expression ] ";"
type ::= "int" | "char"

Array Declaration:
array_decl ::= type IDENTIFIER "[" int_const "]"

Struct Declaration:
struct_decl ::= "struct" IDENTIFIER "{" var_decl_list "}" ";"
var_decl_list ::= declaration { declaration }

c) Statements:
stmt ::= if_stmt | while_stmt | for_stmt | assign_stmt | return_stmt | io_stmt

Assignment Statement:
assign_stmt ::= IDENTIFIER "=" expression ";"

d) Expressions:
expression ::= expression "+" term | expression "-" term | term
term ::= term "*" factor | term "/" factor | factor
factor ::= IDENTIFIER | int_const | "(" expression ")" | func_call

e) Conditional Structures:
If Statement:
if_stmt ::= "if" "(" condition ")" stmt [ "else" stmt ]

While Statement:
while_stmt ::= "while" "(" condition ")" stmt

For Statement:
for_stmt ::= "for" "(" assign_stmt condition ";" assign_stmt ")" stmt

f) Condition:
condition ::= expression RELATION expression
RELATION ::= "==" | "!=" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">="

g) Input/Output Statements:
I/O Statement:
io_stmt ::= "cin" ">>" IDENTIFIER ";" | "cout" "<<" expression ";"

h) Function Call:
func_call ::= IDENTIFIER "(" [argument_list] ")"
argument_list ::= expression {"," expression}
